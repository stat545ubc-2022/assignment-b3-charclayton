This repository contains the BCLiquor folder which contains all required files for Charlotte Clayton's Assignment B3 ShinyApp for Option A and Assignment B4 for Option C (update preexisting shiny app). 

The shiny app for A3 can be found at: https://charlotteclayton.shinyapps.io/BCliquor_A3/

This app is an updated BCLiquor App from what was produced during class.  This updated app allows the user to filter their drink preferences by the country from which the beverage is from, an important parameter for drink selection along with the pre-established selection of price and type of beverage.  The aesthetics of the app have been updated including the BC Liquor logo, a clean shiny app theme and ggplot colours. Finally, the output table based on user input preferences is interactive as the user can control the number of beverages seen in each tab and search the outputs by name. 

The updated shiny app for A4 can be found at: https://charlotteclayton.shinyapps.io/BCliquor_A4/

This app is an updated BCLiquor App from assignment B3.  The app update allows users to filter drink preferences by type of drink, by one or more countries (new feature) and by price. This order of the sidebar filter was reordered from the B3 app based on features that are more important for user preference.  The aesthetics of the app have been updated by removing the bar chart of filtered drinks of preference. This visual output was not a useful feature for users of the app to find BC liquor stocks based on their drink preferences.  The main app output is now an interactive table with the BC liquor stocks based on the user's input.
