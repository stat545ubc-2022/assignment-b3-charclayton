This repository contains the BCLiquor folder which contains all required files for Charlotte Clayton's Assignment B3 ShinyApp for Option A. 

The shiny app can be found at: https://charlotteclayton.shinyapps.io/bcliquor/

This app is an updated BCLiquor App from what was produced during class.  This updated app allows the user to filter their drink preferences by the country from which the beverage is from, an important parameter for drink selection along with the pre-established selection of price and type of beverage.  The aesthetics of the app have been updated including the BC Liquor logo, a clean shiny app theme and ggplot colours. Finally, the output table based on user input preferences is interactive as the user can control the number of beverages seen in each tab and search the outputs by name.
